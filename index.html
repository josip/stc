          <p>
            Oh yes! <em>Simple, tiny &amp; cute.js</em> is yet another charting library for JavaScript! Sure, there's already a gazillion of these but with all the horrible news going on, I've really felt that what the world needs right now is another charting library.
          </p>

          <h2>&#9787; What's with the name?</h2>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Simple &mdash; STC knows only how to draw simple charts, it has no fancy features like drawing negative values or managing labels on the axes (that's all for you to sort it out!)</li>
              <li>Tiny &mdash; It's only 4 KB of compressed JavaScript code and 8 KB when uncompressed. You can even easily remove the features you don't need to squeeze the file size even more.</li>
              <li>Cute &mdash; Just look at the site. Can't you feel it?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>&#9787; One more thing</h2>
          <p>
            STC was actually built for use with <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qmlcanvas">qmlcanvas</a>, a superb piece of code which provides a HTML5 canvas-like API for QML applications. Don't you just love standards?
